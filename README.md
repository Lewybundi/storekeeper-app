## Architecture

### State Management Pattern
```
UI Layer (Widgets)
    ‚Üï
Providers (Riverpod)
    ‚Üï
Repository Layer
    ‚Üï
Database (Drift/SQLite)
```

### Key Providers

- **`productListProvider`**: Manages the list of all products
- **`productByIdProvider`**: Fetches a single product by ID
- **`productSearchProvider`**: Handles search/filter functionality
- **`totalInventoryValueProvider`**: Calculates total inventory worth
- **`lowStockProductsProvider`**: Filters products with low stock

## Features in Detail

### Low Stock Monitoring
Products with quantity less than 10 are automatically flagged:
- Orange badge on product cards
- Listed in dashboard
- Visual warning indicators

### Inventory Calculations
- **Total Value**: `Œ£(price √ó quantity)` for all products
- Real-time updates when products change
- Displayed in dashboard with currency formatting

### Image Handling
- Images stored as BLOB in database
- Compressed for efficient storage
- Displayed with proper aspect ratio
- Placeholder shown when no image available

## Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling:
- Database operation failures
- Image picker cancellations
- Form validation errors
- Network-independent operation

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Products loaded on demand
- **Efficient Rebuilds**: Riverpod minimizes unnecessary widget rebuilds
- **Database Indexing**: Fast queries with proper indexing
- **Image Compression**: Optimized image sizes

## Building for Production

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Generate Coverage
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Build runner fails
```bash
# Solution: Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Issue**: Database not found
```bash
# Solution: Clear app data or reinstall
flutter clean
flutter run
```

**Issue**: Image picker not working
- Ensure permissions are configured in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist
- Check device/emulator has camera/gallery access
